Idea #1, VR Interactive Logic Sandbox - 
  Picture redstone from Minecraft or the old Wiremod from Garry's Mod: the player is given simple transistor analogs and can wire them together in 3D to form various logic circuits. Circuits can be "blackboxed" to hide the logic within and make them easier to work with, allowing the player to build increasingly large pieces of logic. The game can come with several basic I/O elements such as lights or switches to make interacting with a player's machine more fun. To make a real game out of this concept, something akin to Spacechem or Shenzhen I/O could be developed, where the player aims to make the most efficient piece of logic given some constraints. To make a more useful tool out of this concept, the circuits built in VR could be compiled into actual Verilog code. End goal: build, run, and compile into real hardware an LC4 replica using this software.
  
Idea #2, VR Swarm Dogfighting - 
  If you've ever seen Ender's Game, it's like that scene at the end where he directs all of the little fightercraft. The player is essentially an omnipotent director who can pause/slow-down time and direct individual fighter aircraft. Battles become hectically micromanaging high speed planes to shoot other planes without colliding into each other. Ideally this would be multiplayer for maximum flailing fun.
  
Idea #3, VR Tank Crew
    While teleporting is a good form of locomotion for VR, the best is still walking around in 1:1 scale. This is obviously not feasible for many large environments, but there are some real-world counterparts where maybe a player could fit the entire 1:1 scale in their play area. Picture a multiplayer Vive game where players are cramped into a tiny compartment like the inside of a tank and need to manage loading, steering, and directing their vessel while shooting at others--the immersion from VR could be quite impressive with the entire play area mapped. A small submarine or spacecraft crew simulator might also work just as well.
  
  Basically, all concepts which would be annoying/difficult on a simple 2D screen but which could be far more immersive in the Vive.
